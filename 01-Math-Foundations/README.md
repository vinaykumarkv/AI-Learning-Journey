## Resources

### Video Walkthrough
- [Part 1: Why Math for AI + Number Fundamentals](link-to-video) (28 mins)
- [Part 2: Python Setup + Building Calculators](link-to-video) (30 mins)

### Practice Materials
- [Practice problems with solutions](resources/practice-problems.md)
- [Python cheat sheet](resources/python-cheatsheet.md)
- [Common errors and fixes](resources/troubleshooting.md)

## Getting Started

1. **Watch Video 1** or read through the theory sections
2. **Set up your environment** - Follow setup instructions in the first notebook
3. **Code along** with the notebooks - Don't just read, type the code yourself
4. **Complete the exercises** - Active practice is essential
5. **Build the projects** - Customize them with your own data
6. **Troubleshoot errors** - They're learning opportunities, not failures

## Common Challenges & Solutions

**"Python installation isn't working"**
- Use Google Colab as an alternative (zero installation)
- Check the troubleshooting guide in resources/

**"I don't understand the math"**
- The math here is intentionally simple (grade school level)
- Focus on how it's applied, not abstract theory
- Watch the video explanations for visual learning

**"My code has errors"**
- Compare your code character-by-character with the notebook
- Check for typos in variable names
- Post error messages in discussions for help

**"This feels too basic"**
- These fundamentals become building blocks for complex ML algorithms
- Even simple concepts need programming implementation practice
- Skip ahead if truly comfortable, but test yourself with the exercises first

## Success Criteria

You've mastered this module when you can:
- Explain to someone why math is essential for AI (without technical jargon)
- Write Python code for basic calculations without looking at examples
- Create a bar chart from scratch using Matplotlib
- Debug common errors in your code
- Complete the end-of-module project independently

## What's Next

**Module 2: Variables, Graphs & Exponents**
- Working with variables in equations (y = mx + b)
- Understanding coordinate systems and plotting
- Exponential growth and compound interest
- Introduction to linear regression concepts
